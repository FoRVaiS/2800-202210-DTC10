                        The Team here at PaySwap consists of 4 students currently attending the British Columbia Institute of Technology.
                        The members include Shey Barpagga (closest in photo), Malik Nour, Benjamin Chiang, and Richard Fenton (from left to right).
                        This Web-App was contructed within 5-weeks time while we had other course work to take on. 
                        We are very proud of ourselves and hope to provide all of our users with a great experience.

                        PaySwap was designed to help people ensure they are being paid a fair wage. Current solutions are leaving out salaries on the low end.
                        This means that many people working grocery, retail, or fast food may experience unfair pay. We are working to stop this, and to chip
                        away at the ever present gender pay discrimination. We have made all postings anonymous so users can display their age and gender associated with their pay
                        safely. This allows those who feel pay discriminated, to view and ensure they are being paid fair. We at PaySwap want whats best for our community 
                        and encourage you to browse our listings.
